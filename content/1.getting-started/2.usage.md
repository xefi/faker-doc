description: Get started with Faker PHP.
---

Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

This Faker package has been made to answer all previous Faker conception problems.
- Huge download size (More than 3MB)
- Not handling extension well (for open source packages)
- Can't use multiple generators (unique / regex)
- Architecture caveats

## Installation

Faker requires PHP >= 8.3.

```bash
composer require --dev xefi/faker-php
```

## Integrations

If you are using a framework, like `Laravel` or `Symfony`, you might want to look at the [integrations](/getting-started/integrations)

## Basic usage

Using the faker instance you are able to call any extension methods directly.

```php
$faker = new Xefi\Faker\Faker;

echo $faker->numberBetween(1, 10);
```

You might call the same instance multiple times for different results
```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
    echo $faker->numberBetween(1, 10);
}

// 4
// 7
// 3
```

## Localization

By default, the locale is set to `en_US`. If you want to customize yours, see: [https://github.com/TiagoDanin/Locale-Codes](https://github.com/TiagoDanin/Locale-Codes)

Be aware that by default you also have extensions with no locales for your comfort. For example, by using the default package you have a colors extension with latin name.

You have two way to change the faker locale:

### Globally

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker('fr_FR');

$faker->name() // Marie Durand
$faker->name() // Pierre Dupont
```

### For a single execution

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->locale('fr_FR')->name() // Marie Durand
$faker->name() // John Doe (no locale)
```
