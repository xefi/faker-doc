Strategies are a way to control the data you are generating, you are free to add as many as you want

### Unique

Make sure the data you generate is not duplicated with this strategy

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // 2
$faker->unique()->numberBetween(1, 2); // Error too many tries
```

The unique strategy also gives the possibility to use a seed to have multiple unique generator:

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->unique('my-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
$faker->unique('my-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 2
$faker->unique('my-other-seed')->numberBetween(1, 2); // 1
```

## Regex

Regex strategy gives you the possibility to validate your data with a given regex expression:

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->regex('/^01$/')->postalCode(); // Postal code that begins with '01'
$faker->regex('/.com$/')->email(); // Email that ends with '.com'
```

## Valid

The valid strategy allows you to filter generated values using a custom validation callable. The callable must accept one parameter (the generated value) and return a boolean indicating whether the value is valid or not.

```php
use Xefi\Faker\Faker;

$faker = new Faker();

$faker->valid(function ($number) {return $number % 2 === 0; })->numberBetween(1, 100); // Even numbers
$faker->valid(fn ($number) => $number % 2 !== 0)->numberBetween(1, 100); // Odd numbers
$faker->valid(fn ($email) => str_ends_with($email, '.org'))->email(); // Emails that ends by '.org'
```
